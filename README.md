This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses:

- Tailwind CSS v4 with a minimal design token setup in `app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) style components under `components/ui` (for example `button`, `dropdown-menu`, and `card`) built on top of Tailwind.
- Radix UI primitives such as `@radix-ui/react-accordion`, `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, and others used inside the shadcn-style components.

To generate more shadcn/ui components, adjust `components.json` and run the `shadcn` CLI as described in the official docs.
